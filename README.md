# Reconciling 3 Models of the Cyber Threat Intelligence Lifecycle

Bottom Line, Up Front: 
(1) I need to get better at drawing on tablets,

(2) Learning different perspectives on the same topic facilitates improvement, and…

(3) Intelligence Lifecycle doesn’t begin with requirements – it begins with building relationships that lead to clarity on requirements to kickstart the process which leads back to further relationship-building for:

(a) feedback, 
(b) optimization of process for…
(c) higher quality work product, and…
(d) ensuring the “so what” aspect of CTI efforts are leading to the delivery of impactful, meaningful value.

<h2>Situation:</h2>

Three reputable, noteworthy sources – each with extensive discipline in the field of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) – have published their take on the CTI Lifecycle.

Which one is correct?

Which one will facilitate greater results for the practitioner and, ultimately, the organization?

<h2>Discussion:</h2>

Below is an image with the three various models – and noted sources – found for the CTI Lifecycle.

On review, three aspects are of prima facia interest:

<h3>(a) The amount of steps in each lifecycle manifestation.</h3>

Let’s compare –

<h3>(b) Implications</h3>

Recorded Future and Gary Ruddell make a clear distinction on the need to receive guidance on the requirements for the organization.  

Chris Cochran chooses language that departs from the status quo to suggest more engagement vice the suggestion of “taking direction” (granted exclusively by the chosen word: Direction).  

By no means is this to suggest that Recorded Future and/or Gary Ruddell take the position that intelligence requirements are given instead of discussed in two-way dialogue – between the CTI practitioner and the stakeholder(s) that will ultimately receive the intelligence work products going forward.  (For the sake of clarity, I have never once heard, nor read, any such claim by Recorded Future and/or Gary Ruddell; the statements above merely reflect that I do not know their position on stage one of their respective models.)

Further, while Gary Ruddell and Chris Cochran reflected an intelligence lifecycle model that range in a left-to-right comparison of not explicitly stating specific steps in their respective models, it is extremely likely that the steps not written or spoken explicitly – thus shortening their models from 6 steps in listed format – still exist within their respective, published models.  

Having investigated each sources’ work further, it is clear that each model agrees on the following:

+ Intelligence requirements begin with the client/stakeholder. 
+ Collection is essential, as is processing data into information for meaningful analysis.
+ Someone will ultimately receive the intelligence output – and it is hoped that the product will be of significant value, help, and maximum use to those receiving said product.
+ In each model returning to a requirement stage, it is imperative that the CTI professional proactively discover the outcomes of their efforts. 

<h3>(c) Impressions</h3>

I was impressed by the baked-in implication – not stated in the section above merely for the sake of allowing it to be the kickoff point of this section – that it is on the onus of the CTI practitioner to actively pursue the following:

+ Learn of the effectiveness of the work produced

+ Seek out feedback, including confirmation of whether or not the efforts made a difference, whether the needs of the stakeholder/audience of the CTI work product may have adjusted, and even whether to modify the delivery of the work product (such as electronic delivery, deliver-by-hand, scheduled in-person or video conference presentation, etc.).  

+ Optimize the sources of collection for:
 
  + (i.) scope, <br />
  + (ii.) reliability, <br />
  + (iii.) cost,  <br />
  + (iv.) value derived, and even…  <br />
  + (v.) whether a source ought to be let go of.  <br /> 

+ Improve in their ability to deliver the intelligence in a helpful way – which could range from telling a story to relating the information to that which is of interest to the intended audience (even the stakeholder).  

<h3>(d) Congruence</h3>

Each model reinforces their neighboring models. 

By the alignments discovered among the three models aforementioned, it appears that growing awareness of these perspectives on (what is likely intended to be) the same CTI lifecycle – whether simplified or seemingly more complex in the reduction of steps explicitly outlined in the sources’ published lifecycle models – let us assume that all steps are encompassed in each model.  

By that notion, we can reformat the comparison table of steps as follows…

![table2cti3models](https://github.com/reachchrisyoung/CTI-Lifecycle-Notes-1/assets/104402775/57c64acc-6be7-465b-b311-677d6db956c0)

In the table above, each CTI Lifecycle validates the other.

To this end, each model notionally checks off the original six line items reflected in the largest model presented; in this case, that presented by Recorded Future.  

Is one model more superior than the other, however?

<h3>(e) All Models Are Equal in Purpose</h3>

I would suggest that neither model is superior to the other; instead, these are different lenses whereby the same process is viewed.

Further, the shorter, more (notionally) simplistic models (when compared to that by Recorded Future) suggest a commonality in United States Marine Corps tradition: 

Attempting to simply an understanding on something for greater retention and/or implementation.

In one example, the situation report on an enemy target was taught to recruits at Marine Corps Recruit Depot, Parris Island, in the latter part of the 2000s decade by a keyword: SALUTE.

This acronym reflected the components by which the hopeful recruit (if they earn the title United States Marine) may be expected to provide in a radio transmission or executive meeting, encompassing the following components:

S – Size

A – Activity

L – Location

U – Uniform

T – Time

E – Equipment

In harmony with this example, it is likely that the effort was made to reduce and more readily embrace the six steps originally presented in Recorded Future’s text with no intention of omitting the essential and direly needed step of obtaining feedback and asking for the time of the stakeholder to better facilitate their needs in an ongoing fashion.  

<h2> Conclusion: </h2>

The Intelligence Lifecycle doesn’t begin with requirements – it begins with building relationships that lead to clarity on requirements to kickstart the process which leads back to further relationship-building for:

(a) feedback, 
(b) optimization of process for…
(c) higher quality work product, and…
(d) ensuring the “so what” aspect of CTI efforts are leading to the delivery of impactful, meaningful value.

A seasoned veteran of the discipline, Chris Cochran’s E.A.S.Y. Model – on face value – outwardly embraces the implied underpinnings as to how Direction and Collection are pursued and accomplished in a single iteration of the CTI Lifecycle.  

Notwithstanding, Gary Ruddell and Recorded Future unquestionably insist on these things occurring in their model as well, even if simplified to a single word in each step of their respective models.

While the six steps are explicitly stated by Recorded Future, it is likely that the industry-wide, understood expectations of CTI professionals to exercise sound judgment, proactive process and relationship refinement, and discovery of the impact made by their efforts in the workplace – brought forward in consciousness by Gary Ruddell and Chris Cochran – demonstrate that every CTIA and their leadership would be of greatest service to themselves, inner-departmentally, inter-departmentally, and organization-wide, if all three models aforementioned were reviewed and embraced in the ongoing operation of a threat intelligence program.
